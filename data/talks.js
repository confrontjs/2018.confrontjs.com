            priorities, changing requirements, and different personalities.
            This talk focuses on the ever-changing front-end tech landscape,
            along with team management in order to encourage best software
            engineering practices and better team culture across front-end
            teams through real-world use cases and historical lessons learned.

            they are suffering from either - vision, speech, hear, physical

            that we need to make the web accessible for 'All' reason
            is that web was/is by default accessible to everyone but we
            developers are doing something wrong. In this talk we are going
            to see why accessibility is important, type of accessibility
            we need to take care, what we as developers need to do to make
            our web apps accessible for all.

            Recently, bol.com seller dashboards, which used to be a monolith,
            decomposed into microfrontends defined by a business domain
            concept. We experimented on different ways of microfrontend
            techniques and picked one. Since each application can run
            independently on their own minimal setup, this gave the teams
            great flexibility, autonomy and yet improved the ownership
            of the individuals. Despite some drawbacks, such as UX
            consistency, performance issues, etc. this technique definitely
            proved itself within bol.com. In this case study, you will hear
