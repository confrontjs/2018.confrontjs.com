            Dominik is a Frontend Architect with over eight years 
            of experience in JavaScript. However, his real passion 
            is creating extraordinary developer tools for the Web. 
            From the beginning of his programming journey, he wanted 
            to be a creator. Using edge technologies, he builds open 
            source projects, gives talks about them and shares his 
            unique concepts with the community. His latest project 
            - hybrids (UI library for creating web components) - 
            aims to beat the world of developer tools with simple 
            and functional API.
