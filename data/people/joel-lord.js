            Joel Lord is passionate about web and technology in general. He
            likes to learn new things but most of all, he likes to share his
            discoveries. He does so by travelling at various conferences all
            across the globe. He graduated from college in computer programming
            in the last millennium. Apart for a little break to get his BSc
            in computational astrophysics, he was always in the industry.
            As a technical evangelist with Auth0, he meets with developers
            to help them make the web a safer place. During his free time,
            he is usually found stargazing in a camping site somewhere.
